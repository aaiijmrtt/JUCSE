#Numerical Methods Assignment

All algorithms have been implemented using function pointers to allow a greater degree of flexibility and reusability. I rarely use do-while loops. So I decided to overuse them here. An interesting idea would be to port the functions to data structures allowing the use of arbitrary precision arithmetic. Take a look at `llib` in [ARITHMETIC](https://github.com/aaiijmrtt/ARITHMETIC).

**Instructions**:

1. **Compiling**: eg. `$gcc -o numeth numeth.c -lm`
2. **Executing**: eg. `$./numeth`

**Notes**:

* Requires gcc.

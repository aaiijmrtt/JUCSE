#Data Structures and Algorithms Assignment

The implementation of data structures `list` and `sparse` matrix are as powerful and optimized as they are simple. The implementations of `fibonacci`, `factorial`, `name` and `prime` use my arbitrary precision library [lint](https://github.com/aaiijmrtt/ARITHMETIC). The algorithm used to generate a `random` shuffled list of numbers has linear space and time complexities, as opposed to the naive quadratic implementations. The implementations of the `search` algorithms are generic, with close to template-like behaviour in C, achieved through the use of void and function pointers.

**Instructions**:

1. **Compiling**: eg. `$gcc lint -o prime prime.c -lm`
2. **Executing**: eg. `$./prime 3000 10 50`

**Notes**:

* Instructions above are not generic. Each has its unique usage.
* Requires gcc.
* Requires [lint](https://github.com/aaiijmrtt/ARITHMETIC).

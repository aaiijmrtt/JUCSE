#Design Assignment

A digitizer was designed and implemented. Two potentiometers were attached to the shoulder and elbow of an arm, to the wrist of which was attached a pointer. The potentiometers provide a linear mapping from angles to voltage. The voltages are read by the microprocessor (`driver.asm`) and translated to Cartesian coordinates (`translate.asm`). The voltages (`voltages.asm`) and coordinates (`coordinates.asm`) were displayed. The theory of conversion is presented in `theory.pdf`. A limited sensitivity lookup table was pregenerated by `points.py`, after handcalibration.

**Notes**:

* Requires Python.
* Requires MatplotLib.
* Requires 8085 Microprocessor Traning Kit.

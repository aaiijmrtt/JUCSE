#Object Oriented Programming Assignment

The core classes consist of private datamembers (to prevent unchecked access and to localise debugging) and a public interface of setter and getter functions for use. A minimalistic implementation of these classes has been provided, but has not been stressed upon. This has been done to keep the classes independent of any specific implementation strategy that the user may employ, which will vary between applications. However, a fully functional set of helper functions (which may be wrapped into a common namespace and provided along with the class) have been provided to demonstrate a possible implementation. The use of the main function has been restricted to the calling of these helper functions, allowing access to the core class features, reducing work on the implementor's end. Error handling has been enforced extensively to make the designs robust.

All sources have been extensively and consistantly commented to facilitate generation of documentation using `doxygen`. The folder containing the Java assignments was named `myjava` to prevent namespace collision with native `java` hierarchies. The subpackages and C++ assignments were named in keeping with that convention.

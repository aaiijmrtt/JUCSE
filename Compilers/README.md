#Compilers Assignment

`lexer.py` contains a lexer and `parser.py` contains a parser, implemented in python. The implementations are naive: optimization has not been attempted to aid understandability and emphasize the fundamental underlying algorithms. A sample toy grammar for a C like language has been included in `grammar.txt`. It is assumed that the input in stored in a file named `input.c`. The lexer generates an intermediate file, `intermediate.txt`, for the parser.

`mylang.l` contains a lex specification and `mylang.y` contains a yacc specification for a toy Lisp like language. `lex.yy.c`, `y.tab.h` and `y.tab.c` were generated by lex and yacc.

**Instructions**:

1. **Executing**: eg. `$python lexer.py`

**Notes**:

* Requires Python.
* Requires Lex.
* Requires Yacc.
